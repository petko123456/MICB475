Topic/Research Question has been chosen: 
-  How does the microbiome differ based on the age of onset of multiple sclerosis 
-  We have the duration of dieasea and age as well so we can find the onset and duration of MS.
-  Using alpha and beta diversity to compare between groups (Data analysis)
-  Indicator species analysis + Differential abundnace (diff between age groups but need to set with something as baseline) + functional analysis... Do a bit more than alpha and beta
-  Come up with 4-5 figures 
-  2 or 3 panels per figure

Next steps:
-  Follow the Qiime2 processing it can take up to a few days should be done by next meeting 
-  Start the proposal for next meeting so that Chad can take a look at it 

Project roles:
-  QiangCheng Yu and Marcelo Reinaldo will be mostly in charge of coding related work (Qiime2 will be done by QiangCheng Yu and with R processing and analysis will be mainly Marcelo with the help of Yu)
-  Petko and Kevin will be mostly responsible for the written portion of the project but Marcelo and QiangCheng could assist with editing whenever needed.
