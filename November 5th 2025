What to do next: Make some progress for the next 2 weeks
- By Nov 19th pre-aim preperation (onset age variable calculation)
- Filter out the pediatric onset
- Follow the proposed appraoch
- Alpha and Beta diversity metrics 
- FIgure making should also be done by next meeting 
- Aim 2 and literature search should probably be done by the 19th
- Aim 2 figure making should be done
- Aim 3 pre-lim data should be done 
- **All aims should be done**
